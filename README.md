Random Colour Generator

This is a simple web app for generating and saving colours.

You can generate a random colour that changes the page background, save colours you like, and view them in a small menu. Clicking a saved colour applies it again and copies the hex code. There’s also a delete mode where saved colours shake and can be removed by clicking them.

You can manually enter a hex code to apply a specific colour, and the buttons and menu automatically switch between light and dark so everything stays readable.

Built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No backend or storage, everything runs in the browser.
